# chatGPTCopyAsMarkdown

This is a simple chrome extension that adds a copy button next to every message written by chatGPT bot. Clicking on this button will copy the message content as markdown to your system clipboard.

## Usage

To use the extension, simply locate the message you want to copy and click on the copy button next to it. The message content will be copied to your clipboard as markdown.

## TODO

The extension currently does not correctly parse and format code blocks. This feature is currently in development and will be implemented in a future update.
